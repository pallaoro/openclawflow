> The n8n for agents. A declarative, AI-native workflow format that agents can read, write, and run — without infrastructure.

---

## The Problem

Every agent framework today makes the same mistake: workflows are written **for** agents, not **by** them.

- **n8n** — beautiful visual canvas, but humans click nodes together. Agents can't write n8n workflows reliably.
- **Lobster** (OpenClaw) — deterministic CLI pipe runner. Great for shell scripts, wrong shape for AI-first workflows.
- **LangGraph** — graph state machines in Python. Powerful, but the syntax surface is too large for LLMs to generate reliably.
- **Cloudflare Workflows** — TypeScript classes with durable execution. Excellent runtime, but code-first — agents hallucinate class structure.
- **Temporal / Prefect / Airflow** — enterprise-grade orchestration, massive surface area, not designed for agent authorship.

None of them answer the core question: **what if the agent itself needs to design, build, and modify the workflow?**

---

## The Vision

**`clawflow` is a workflow format designed from first principles for agents.**

Three rules drove every design decision:

1. **An LLM must be able to write a valid workflow from a natural language description in a single turn.** If the format is too complex, agents hallucinate structure. If it's too simple, real workflows can't be expressed.

2. **The format is the asset, not the runtime.** Write once, run as an OpenClaw plugin today, deploy to Cloudflare Workers tomorrow, run in a standalone server next month. The spec outlives any particular runtime.

3. **AI nodes are first-class citizens, not HTTP calls with extra steps.** Every other workflow tool treats AI as just another integration. Here, `do: ai` and `do: agent` are core primitives with their own semantics: structured output, model selection, schema validation.

---

## The Format

A flow is a JSON (or YAML) document. No custom syntax, no new language — just structured data that any LLM can generate from a description.

```json
{
  "flow": "support-triage",
  "description": "Classify a ticket, draft a reply, get approval, send it",
  "trigger": { "on": "webhook", "from": "helpdesk" },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "classify",
      "do": "ai",
      "prompt": "Classify this ticket as billing, technical, or general",
      "input": "trigger.body",
      "schema": {
        "category": "billing | technical | general",
        "urgency": "low | medium | high",
        "summary": "string"
      },
      "model": "fast",
      "output": "classification"
    },
    {
      "name": "route",
      "do": "branch",
      "on": "classification.category",
      "paths": {
        "billing":   "handle-billing",
        "technical": "handle-technical"
      },
      "default": "handle-general"
    },
    {
      "name": "handle-billing",
      "do": "agent",
      "task": "Draft a billing support reply for: {{ trigger.body }}",
      "model": "smart",
      "output": "draft"
    },
    {
      "name": "approve",
      "do": "wait",
      "for": "approval",
      "prompt": "Send this reply?\n\n{{ draft }}"
    },
    {
      "name": "send",
      "do": "http",
      "url": "https://helpdesk.example.com/api/reply",
      "method": "POST",
      "body": { "message": "{{ draft }}", "ticketId": "{{ trigger.id }}" },
      "retry": { "limit": 3, "delay": "2s", "backoff": "exponential" }
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Node Types

10 node types. This is intentional — the constraint is the feature. An LLM can reliably generate valid flows because there's nothing to hallucinate.

### `do: ai` — LLM call

The most important node. A single LLM call that returns structured or freeform output.

```json
{
  "name": "classify",
  "do": "ai",
  "prompt": "Classify this support ticket",
  "input": "trigger.body",
  "schema": {
    "category": "billing | technical | general",
    "confidence": "number",
    "summary": "string"
  },
  "model": "fast",
  "output": "classification"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | The instruction to the model. Supports `{{ templates }}`. |
| `input` | Dotted path to a value in flow state passed as context |
| `schema` | Output shape. When set, enforces JSON mode. Keys are type hints. |
| `model` | `fast` (Haiku), `smart` (Sonnet), `best` (Opus), or any model string |
| `temperature` | 0–1, default 0 for deterministic workflow steps |

**Why schema matters:** downstream nodes reference `classification.category` as a reliable string. Without schema, the output is freeform text and you're back to parsing.

---

### `do: agent` — delegate to a real agent

Runs a task through a real OpenClaw agent with full tool access (browser, exec, memory, etc.). The agent decides its own path to a result.

```json
{
  "name": "scrape",
  "do": "agent",
  "task": "Navigate to https://example.com and extract the pricing table as JSON",
  "agent": "main",
  "timeout": "120s",
  "output": "data"
}
```

On OpenClaw, this delegates to `openclaw agent --agent <id> --message "..."`. The agent gets full tool access — browser, shell, file system, memory. Falls back to a single AI call if the CLI is unavailable (standalone mode).

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `task` | The instruction to the agent. Supports `{{ templates }}`. |
| `agent` | OpenClaw agent ID (e.g. `"main"`, `"ops"`). Uses config `defaultAgent` or `"main"` if omitted. |
| `input` | Dotted path to context passed with the task |
| `tools` | Hint for non-OpenClaw runtimes (OpenClaw agents have their own tool policy) |
| `model` | Model for fallback AI call (standalone mode only) |

The distinction between `ai` and `agent` is intentional:
- `do: ai` = deterministic, one-shot, structured output — use for classification, drafting, extraction
- `do: agent` = open-ended, multi-step, uses tools — use for scraping, research, file operations

---

### `do: branch` — conditional routing

Routes the flow to a different node based on a value in state.

```json
{
  "name": "route",
  "do": "branch",
  "on": "classification.category",
  "paths": {
    "billing":   "handle-billing",
    "technical": "handle-technical",
    "general":   "handle-general"
  },
  "default": "handle-general"
}
```

Branches jump to named nodes. The `default` path handles any value not explicitly listed. No `default` + no matching path = runtime error (intentional — fail loudly).

**Note:** `branch` jumps to a target node and continues sequentially from there. For if/else logic that reconverges, use `do: condition` instead.

---

### `do: condition` — if/else with reconvergence

Runs inline sub-node blocks based on a condition, then merges back into the main flow. Unlike `branch` (which jumps), condition blocks are self-contained.

```json
{
  "name": "check-transport",
  "do": "condition",
  "if": "extractOrder.transport_type == 'CLIENTE'",
  "then": [
    { "name": "pickup-note", "do": "code", "run": "'Client picks up'", "output": "note" }
  ],
  "else": [
    { "name": "delivery-note", "do": "code", "run": "'We deliver'", "output": "note" }
  ]
}
```

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `if` | JS expression evaluated against flow state. Dotted paths are resolved. |
| `then` | Nodes to run when condition is true |
| `else` | Nodes to run when condition is false (optional — skipped if absent) |

Supports comparison and logical operators:
```
"classification.priority == 'urgent'"
"validation.valid && items.length > 0"
"trigger.amount > 1000 || trigger.vip == true"
```

---

### `do: loop` — iterate over a list

Runs a set of sub-nodes for each item in an array.

```json
{
  "name": "process-tickets",
  "do": "loop",
  "over": "inbox.tickets",
  "as": "ticket",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "summarize",
      "do": "ai",
      "prompt": "Summarize this ticket: {{ ticket }}",
      "output": "summary"
    }
  ],
  "output": "processed"
}
```

Iterations run sequentially. For concurrent execution, use `do: parallel`.

---

### `do: parallel` — concurrent execution

Runs multiple nodes at the same time. Waits for all to complete (`mode: "all"`) or the first to finish (`mode: "race"`).

```json
{
  "name": "research",
  "do": "parallel",
  "mode": "all",
  "nodes": [
    {
      "name": "web-search",
      "do": "agent",
      "task": "Search the web for recent cases of {{ topic }}",
      "output": "web_results"
    },
    {
      "name": "memory-lookup",
      "do": "memory",
      "action": "read",
      "key": "knowledge-{{ topic }}",
      "output": "memory_results"
    }
  ],
  "output": "research"
}
```

`mode: "race"` mirrors Cloudflare's `Promise.race()` pattern — the first branch to complete wins and the others are discarded. Useful for: try-cache-before-fetch, multi-model racing, fallback strategies.

---

### `do: http` — external API call

```json
{
  "name": "notify-slack",
  "do": "http",
  "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/{{ trigger.slackWebhook }}",
  "method": "POST",
  "body": { "text": "Ticket resolved: {{ classification.summary }}" },
  "retry": { "limit": 3, "delay": "1s", "backoff": "exponential" },
  "output": "slack_response"
}
```

All fields support `{{ templates }}`. Retry is strongly recommended for any outbound call.

---

### `do: memory` — persistent key/value store

Read, write, or delete values that persist across flow runs.

```json
{ "name": "save-result",  "do": "memory", "action": "write",  "key": "ticket-{{ trigger.id }}", "value": "{{ classification.category }}" }
{ "name": "load-history", "do": "memory", "action": "read",   "key": "ticket-{{ trigger.id }}", "output": "previous_category" }
{ "name": "cleanup",      "do": "memory", "action": "delete", "key": "ticket-{{ trigger.id }}" }
```

In the OpenClaw plugin, memory persists to `~/.openclaw/flow-memory/`. In Cloudflare, it maps to KV or D1. Keys support templates.

---

### `do: wait` — pause for human or external event

Two modes:

**Approval gate** — pauses the flow and returns a `resumeToken`. A human reviews and approves or denies via `flow_resume`.

```json
{
  "name": "approve-send",
  "do": "wait",
  "for": "approval",
  "prompt": "Send this reply to the customer?\n\n{{ draft }}"
}
```

**External event** — blocks until an external system pushes the matching event via `flow_send_event`. Learned from Cloudflare's `step.waitForEvent()`.

```json
{
  "name": "await-payment",
  "do": "wait",
  "for": "event",
  "event": "stripe-payment-confirmed",
  "timeout": "24h",
  "output": "payment"
}
```

When a Stripe webhook arrives, the calling code does:
```json
{ "tool": "flow_send_event", "instanceId": "...", "eventType": "stripe-payment-confirmed", "payload": { "amount": 4900 } }
```

The flow resumes with `payment.amount = 4900` in state.

---

### `do: sleep` — time-based pause

```json
{ "name": "cool-down", "do": "sleep", "duration": "5m" }
```

Duration syntax: `30s`, `5m`, `2h`, `1d`. Maps directly to Cloudflare's `step.sleep()`. Does not count towards step limits.

---

### `do: code` — inline expression

```json
{
  "name": "format-date",
  "do": "code",
  "input": "trigger.timestamp",
  "run": "new Date(input).toLocaleDateString('en-GB')",
  "output": "formatted_date"
}
```

Constrained: synchronous expressions only, no imports, no async. For anything more complex, use `do: http` to call a function or `do: agent` with a code-writing tool.

---

## Templates

Any string field supports `{{ path.to.value }}` interpolation resolved against flow state:

```
{{ trigger.body }}              # initial input
{{ classify.category }}         # output from node named "classify"
{{ trigger.user.email }}        # nested dotted path
{{ research.web_results }}      # array or object (serialized to JSON string)
```

Flow state starts as `{ trigger: <input> }` and grows as nodes complete.

---

## Retry Policy

Any node can define per-node retry behavior. Learned directly from Cloudflare's `WorkflowStepConfig`:

```json
{
  "retry": {
    "limit": 3,
    "delay": "2s",
    "backoff": "exponential"
  }
}
```

| Field | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `limit` | integer | 1 (no retry) |
| `delay` | duration string or ms | `"0"` |
| `backoff` | `constant`, `linear`, `exponential` | `constant` |

Strongly recommended on `do: http` and `do: ai` nodes. Do not use on `do: wait` — retrying approval gates makes no sense.

---

## Flow State and Durability

Every flow run gets a unique `instanceId`. The runner persists state after every completed node to `~/.openclaw/flow-state/<instanceId>.json`.

**What this means in practice:**

- Gateway restarts mid-flow? Already-completed nodes are not re-run. The flow resumes from the last checkpoint.
- A node that took 30 seconds to run won't run again on resume — its memoized output is loaded from disk.
- An approval-gated flow can stay paused for days. The state survives indefinitely.

This is the lightweight equivalent of Cloudflare Durable Objects' memoization. Cloudflare does it at the infrastructure level with global durability. We do it at the file system level for local/self-hosted use.

---

## Runtime Targets

The format is the spec. The runtime is swappable.

### 1. OpenClaw Plugin (current)

Five tools registered in OpenClaw:

| Tool | Does |
|---|---|
| `flow_run` | Execute a flow inline or from a file |
| `flow_resume` | Resume after an approval gate |
| `flow_send_event` | Push an event into a waiting flow |
| `flow_status` | Inspect any running or completed instance |
| `flow_transpile` | Convert a flow to Cloudflare Workers TypeScript |

**Install:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/clawnify/clawflow.git
cd clawflow && npm install && npm run build
openclaw plugins install --link ./clawflow
```

**Config:**
```json
{
  "plugins": {
    "entries": {
      "clawflow": {
        "enabled": true,
        "config": { "defaultModel": "smart" }
      }
    }
  },
  "agents": {
    "list": [{
      "id": "main",
      "tools": { "alsoAllow": ["flow_run", "flow_resume", "flow_send_event", "flow_status", "flow_transpile"] }
    }]
  }
}
```

---

### 2. Cloudflare Workers + Workflows (transpiler)

`flow_transpile` converts any `.flow` definition to a complete Cloudflare `WorkflowEntrypoint` TypeScript class.

Node mapping:

| clawflow | Cloudflare Workflows |
|---|---|
| `do: ai` | `step.do()` with AI provider call |
| `do: agent` | `step.do()` with extended AI call |
| `do: wait / for: event` | `step.waitForEvent({ type, timeout })` |
| `do: sleep` | `step.sleep(name, duration)` |
| `do: parallel / mode: race` | `Promise.race([step.do, ...])` |
| `do: parallel / mode: all` | `Promise.all([step.do, ...])` |
| `do: http` | `step.do()` wrapping `fetch()` |
| `do: memory` | `step.do()` wrapping KV/D1 |
| retry policy | `step.do(name, config, callback)` |

The transpiler gives you:
- **Durable execution** — Cloudflare guarantees steps complete exactly once, globally
- **Long-running flows** — minutes, hours, weeks — without timeouts
- **Global scale** — Cloudflare's network, not your server
- **Audit trail** — Cloudflare's Workflows dashboard shows every step

---

### 3. Standalone Node.js Runner (planned)

A small HTTP server wrapping the runner. Expose flows as endpoints, receive webhooks, manage instances via REST API. Self-hosted alternative to Cloudflare.

```
POST  /flows/:name/run       # start a flow instance
POST  /flows/resume          # resume paused flow
POST  /flows/event           # send event to waiting flow
GET   /flows/instances       # list all instances
GET   /flows/instances/:id   # get instance status
```

---

### 4. Flow Registry (planned)

A community library of reusable, shareable `.flow` definitions. Think npm for workflows — or n8n's template library, but agent-writable.

```
clawflow install support-triage
clawflow install github-pr-review
clawflow install invoice-processing
clawflow install lead-enrichment
```

Every flow in the registry is:
- Parameterized (inputs declared in `trigger`)
- Runtime-agnostic (runs on OpenClaw or Cloudflare)
- LLM-editable (agents can fork and modify them)

---

## How Agents Build Workflows

This is the core loop that makes this different from every other workflow tool:

```
User:  "When a new GitHub PR is opened, have an AI review the diff,
        check if all tests pass, and if the review is positive
        post an approval — otherwise request changes with specific feedback"

Agent: [calls flow_run with an inline flow definition it just generated]

→ flow runs
→ AI reviews diff (do: ai)
→ checks CI status (do: http → GitHub API)
→ branches on review result (do: branch)
→ posts comment (do: http → GitHub API)
```

The agent doesn't need a visual canvas. It doesn't need to learn a DSL. It reads the node type descriptions from the tool definition and generates valid JSON in one turn.

### System prompt for flow authorship

Add this to a skill or system prompt to enable an agent to write flows:

```
You can design and run workflows using flow_run.
Flows are JSON with a "flow" name and "nodes" array.

Node types: ai, agent, branch, loop, parallel, http, memory, wait, sleep, code

Rules:
- Every node needs a unique "name"
- Use "output" to name a node's result — other nodes reference it as {{ nodeName.field }}
- Always add "schema" to ai nodes when downstream nodes need typed fields
- Use "retry" on all http nodes: { "limit": 3, "delay": "2s", "backoff": "exponential" }
- Use "do: agent" for open-ended research/tasks, "do: ai" for structured extraction
- "do: wait" with "for: approval" pauses for human review before side effects
- "do: parallel" runs nodes concurrently; use when steps are independent
- Prefer "model": "fast" for classification, "smart" for drafting, "best" for complex reasoning
```

## Why This Becomes the n8n for Agents

n8n won because it gave non-developers a way to wire together integrations visually. The market it created was enormous.

The next version of that market isn't humans clicking nodes. It's agents designing their own automation. The inbox for agents is being built. The CRM for agents is being built. The workflow layer for agents hasn't been built yet.

The gap isn't another visual canvas. It's a **format that agents can write**, combined with a **runtime that's durable enough to be trusted** with real business processes.

clawflow is a bet that the format comes first. Get the spec right, build the OpenClaw plugin to validate it, transpile to Cloudflare to prove portability, build the registry to prove the ecosystem. The canvas comes last, once the format is stable — because at that point you're just rendering JSON you already understand.

## Contributing

The most valuable contributions right now:

1. **Real-world flow definitions** — try to describe a workflow you actually run, generate the `.flow` JSON, and report where the format breaks down
2. **Transpiler completeness** — test the Cloudflare transpiler output and file issues for nodes that don't map cleanly
3. **Node type proposals** — what's the 10th node type? What real workflow pattern can't be expressed with the current 9?
4. **Runtime implementations** — a Python runner, a Go runner, a Rust runner — anything that proves portability
